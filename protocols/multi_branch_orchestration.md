# Multi-Branch Orchestration Protocol ðŸŒ³

## Architecture Overview

```
main (Orchestrator - Control Center)
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/data-processor
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/file-manager
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/monitor
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/security
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/builder
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/tester
â””â”€â”€ agent/deployer
```

## Core Principles

1. **Main Branch = Orchestrator HQ**
   - Central command and control
   - Task distribution
   - Result aggregation
   - Conflict resolution

2. **Agent Branches = Isolated Workspaces**
   - Independent execution
   - Parallel processing
   - No interference between agents
   - Specialized permissions

## Workflow

### 1. Task Assignment
```bash
# Orchestrator on main
git checkout main
# Assigns task to agent
echo "$TASK" > tasks/agent_name/task_$ID.json
git add . && git commit -m "Assign task $ID to $AGENT"
git push
```

### 2. Agent Execution
```bash
# Agent switches to its branch
git checkout agent/data-processor
git merge main --no-ff  # Get new tasks
# Process tasks...
git add . && git commit -m "Complete task $ID"
git push
```

### 3. Result Integration
```bash
# Orchestrator pulls results
git checkout main
git merge agent/data-processor --no-ff
# Validate and integrate results
```

## Parallel Execution Benefits

- **10x Speed**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **No Conflicts**: Each agent has isolated workspace
- **Clean History**: Clear task tracking per branch
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy to revert agent changes
- **Permission Isolation**: Each branch can have different access levels

## Agent Branch Setup Commands

```bash
# Create agent branches
git checkout -b agent/data-processor
git checkout -b agent/file-manager
git checkout -b agent/monitor
git checkout -b agent/security
git checkout -b agent/builder
git checkout -b agent/tester
git checkout -b agent/deployer

# Return to main
git checkout main
```

## Task Distribution Algorithm

1. Analyze incoming task
2. Determine best agent(s) for the job
3. Split task if parallelizable
4. Assign to multiple branches
5. Monitor progress
6. Merge results
7. Report completion

## Synchronization Rules

- **Hourly Sync**: Agents pull from main every hour
- **On-Demand Sync**: For urgent tasks
- **Conflict Resolution**: Main branch has final authority
- **Result Validation**: All merges reviewed by orchestrator

## Performance Metrics

- Tasks per minute
- Parallel execution ratio
- Branch utilization
- Merge success rate
- Conflict frequency

## Emergency Protocols

- **Agent Failure**: Reassign task to another agent
- **Branch Corruption**: Create new branch from main
- **Deadlock**: Force merge with orchestrator override
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Queue management
