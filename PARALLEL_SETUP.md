# ðŸš€ PARALLEL EXECUTION SETUP - REAL

## EVERYTHING IS NOW ON GITHUB!
Repository: https://github.com/DabtcAvila/Orchestrator

## HOW TO SET UP REAL PARALLEL EXECUTION:

### Terminal 1 - ORCHESTRATOR (Main Branch)
```bash
# I'm already here on main branch
# I will coordinate tasks and merge results
git checkout main
```

### Terminal 2 - DATA PROCESSOR AGENT
Open new terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/Users/davicho/MASTER proyectos/Orchestrator"
git checkout agent/data-processor
# Start Claude here and tell it:
# "You are a Data Processor Agent on branch agent/data-processor"
# "Pull tasks from main, process them, commit and push results"
```

### Terminal 3 - MONITOR AGENT
Open new terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/Users/davicho/MASTER proyectos/Orchestrator"
git checkout agent/monitor
# Start Claude here and tell it:
# "You are a Monitor Agent on branch agent/monitor"
# "Monitor system health, create alerts, commit and push"
```

### Terminal 4 - FILE MANAGER AGENT
Open new terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/Users/davicho/MASTER proyectos/Orchestrator"
git checkout agent/file-manager
# Start Claude here and tell it:
# "You are a File Manager Agent on branch agent/file-manager"
# "Handle file operations, backups, commit and push"
```

## COORDINATION PROTOCOL:

### 1. Task Assignment (from Orchestrator - main):
```bash
# Create task file
echo '{"task": "process data", "agent": "data-processor"}' > tasks/data_processor_task.json
git add . && git commit -m "Task: Assigned to data-processor"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Agent Pulls Task (from Agent branch):
```bash
git pull origin main
# Process task...
# Create results
echo '{"result": "completed"}' > results/task_complete.json
git add . && git commit -m "Results: Task completed"
git push origin agent/data-processor
```

### 3. Orchestrator Merges Results:
```bash
git pull origin agent/data-processor
git merge agent/data-processor --no-ff
git push origin main
```

## REAL PARALLEL TASK EXAMPLE:

### From Orchestrator (this terminal):
1. Create 3 tasks simultaneously
2. Push to main
3. Wait for agents to process
4. Merge all results

### Each Agent (other terminals):
1. Pull from main
2. Find their task
3. Process independently
4. Push results to their branch

## START NOW:

1. **Open 3 more terminals**
2. **In each, checkout the agent branch**
3. **Start Claude in each terminal**
4. **Tell me when ready**
5. **I'll coordinate a real parallel task!**

## COMMUNICATION:
- Tasks go in: `tasks/[agent]_task.json`
- Results go in: `results/[agent]_result.json`
- Logs go in: `logs/[agent].log`

Ready for REAL parallel execution! ðŸŽ¯
